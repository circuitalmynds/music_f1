There's some clicking and crackling on this one, which I guess is understandable as it is over 50 years old. The sleevenotes refer to a forthcoming tour of the western United States, Canada and Europe in early 1957.\nThis video is for educational purpose and not for financial gains. I don't own any rights.\n\nTwo things struck me as I listened to this record. Firstly the standard of the music. These guys really rock. Secondly the standard of sound reproduction. CDs and mp3s just can't compare to original vinyl discs when it comes to delivering gutsy whomp. This is the best way to experience the big beat.\n\nThis EP and the earlier one  belonged to my pal's dad. They've been lying in my record cupboard for years..",
