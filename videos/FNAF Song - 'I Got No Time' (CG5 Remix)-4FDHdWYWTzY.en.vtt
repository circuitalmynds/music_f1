00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.040
I got no time,
I got no time to live.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.500
I got no time to live and I can't say goodbye.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.850
And I'm regretting having memories
Of my friends who they used to be

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.220
Beside me before they left me to die.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.040
And I know this is,
I know this is the truth,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.000
'Cause I've been staring at my death so many
times.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.100
These scary monsters roaming in the halls,
I wish I could just block the doors,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.700
And stay in bed until the clock will chime.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.420
So my flashlight's on,
And stay up til dawn.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.160
I got this headache and my life's on the line.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.100
I felt like I won, but I wasn't done.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.980
The nightmare repeats itself everytime.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.560
Gotta keep my calm, and carry on,
Stay awake until the sun will shine.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.520
But I'm not so strong,
And they're not gone.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.980
They're still out there to take what's left
of mine.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.640
I have this urge,
I have this urge to kill.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.400
I have this urge to kill and show that I'm
alive.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.660
I'm getting sick from these apologies,
From people with priorities,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.080
That their life matters so much more than
mine.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.780
But I'm stuttering,
I'm stuttering again.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.600
No one will listen and no one will understand,
Because I'm crying as much as I speak,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.900
'Cause no one likes me when I shriek.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.780
Want to go back to where it all began.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.220
So my flashlight's on,
And stay up til dawn.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.920
I got this headache and my life's on the line.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.920
I felt like I won, but I wasn't done.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.640
The nightmare repeats itself everytime.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.260
Gotta keep my calm, and carry on,
Stay awake until the sun will shine.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.160
But I'm not so strong,
And they're not gone.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.940
They're still out there to take what's left
of mine.
