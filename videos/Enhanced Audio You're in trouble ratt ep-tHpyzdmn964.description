I created this from the Euro version of the Ratt EP using an Optimus Lab 1100 through my pioneer receiver and NAD amp out to the stock soundcard in my Laptop.  Came out nice and clean with no pops.  This is better than any other version I heard.  I'm really picky when it comes to sound.  Enjoy!  Early version of the song that appears on Out of the Cellar.
